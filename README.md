# 📱 Price Determinants of Tablets in the Indian Market : A Web Scraping and EDA Project
## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses web-scraped product data to analyze which hardware specifications, brand positioning, and promotional offers drive tablet pricing in India. I scraped product listings from Flipkart, cleaned and standardized the data, and conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify pricing patterns, brand segments, and value-for-money recommendations for consumers.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Help consumers choose the right tablet based on budget, performance features, brand reputation, and specifications such as RAM, ROM, and display size.
- Identify trends in brand-wise pricing, feature distribution, and the overall positioning of tablets in the Indian market.
- Examine how specifications (RAM, ROM, battery capacity, display size, cameras, connectivity) influence minimum, maximum, and average prices.
- Correlate specifications, brand category, and customer ratings to determine which tablets offer the best balance between price and performance.
- Detect patterns such as premium pricing clusters, budget segments, and spec combinations commonly used by brands to differentiate their products.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps
- Removed special characters from price and discount columns.
- Dropped duplicated rows.
- Identified all null values and imputed them using appropriate strategies.
- Converted all numeric and categorical fields columns into correct data types.
- Detected outliers using the IQR method.
- Retained them after confirming they represent genuine premium tablets.
- Standardized categorical columns by converting all category text to lowercase for consistency.

## 📊 Univariate Analysis — Key Insights
- Apple dominates the dataset, followed by Samsung; Lenovo sits mid-range; all other brands appear in small numbers.
- Prices are heavily right-skewed; most tablets fall between ₹10,000–₹30,000.
- Most tablets feature 4GB RAM and 128GB ROM, showing a shift toward mid-range hardware.
- Calling-enabled tablets (Wi-Fi + SIM) account for 56%, showing strong preference over Wi-Fi-only tablets.

## 🔗 Bivariate Analysis — Key Patterns
- Battery vs Price: Higher prices correlate with larger batteries, especially above 9000 mAh.
- Display Size vs Price: Prices generally rise with larger displays.
- Brand vs Price: Apple > Samsung > OnePlus dominate premium listings.
- Connectivity vs Price: Wi-Fi + SIM tablets are consistently more expensive.
- RAM vs Price: Price increases with RAM, especially 8GB+.
- ROM vs Price: Higher storage (128GB+, especially 256GB) aligns with higher pricing.
- Correlation Heatmap: Display size and camera quality show stronger correlations compared to RAM and battery.
